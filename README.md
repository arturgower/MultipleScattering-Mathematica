A package to calculate multiple scattering according to the 2D wave equation. All scatterers at present need to be cylinders or the same size, but can be placed anywhere. The incident wave can be anything, but the default for the package is the 2D green's function. There are functions to calculate the total wave in frequency and time, together with examples on how to plot them.
